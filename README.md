Kubernetes is the Greek word for Helmsman of a ship. This name was chosen because it oversees a set of servers and decides where to deploy containerized applications, when to scale up or down the number of application replicas and what to do when an application or server stops working. The first thing one would need to understand before learning Kubernetes is, Containers. Containers are virtual environments which are isolated and have no knowledge of your operating system. A container requires a container engine (for example: Docker) to be installed on any Operating system on which it is expected to work. </p>
